We are in the lobby. In this room there are 4 portals leading to different games. Yellow portal leads to the shooting range. Blue portal leads to a bowling game. Red portal leads to a basketball court. Purple portal leads to a dart game.

Bowling: Use the side lanes to practice individual throws. The main part of the game takes place on the central lane, following classic bowling rules. Pressing the X button on the left controller opens the game menu, where you can change settings.

Shooting Range: Before starting the game, set the difficulty level of the shooting range by clicking X on the left controller. A UI for difficulty selection will appear. To start the game, press the button and pick up the weapon, both located on the table. The goal is to shoot all targets as quickly as possible. To reload the weapon, use the other hand to remove the empty magazine and insert a new one (pick it up from the table) deeply into the pistol. On the right side of the table, there is a Game Menu for changing settings.

Darts: On the right wall, select the target score, choose the color of the board and darts, and start the game. Classic dart game rules apply. Pressing the X button on the left controller opens the game menu, where you can change settings.

Basketball: Upon entering the scene, you can shoot hoops in sandbox mode. However, pressing the B button on the controller starts a 30-second timer. During this time, aim to make as many baskets as possible. The score will be displayed on the wall to the left of the player. Pressing the X button on the left controller opens the game menu, where you can change settings.";
